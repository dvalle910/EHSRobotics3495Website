							<p align="center">This is updated weekly, so tune in here so you do not miss out on the latest news from Edison High Mindcraft Robotics Team 3495!</p>

							<h2>WEEKLY BLOG</h2>
							<p> Team 3495 wants to keep you updated on what we're up to!  </p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h2>Week One</h2>
							<p>To start off, Mindcraft would like to thank you all for your support in prepping for the start of this 
							build season. This year will not be possible without the support of our amazing parents, sponsors, and mentors
							who have dedicated their time and expertise in our times of need. The purpose of this weekly newsletter is to 
							keep everyone informed on the progress we've made, as well as what is coming up for our team in the near future. 
							As Week One of Build Season comes to a close, here is the progress we've made for this year's game, FIRST Power Up. 
							We'd like to thank all the friends and family who came to support the team for this year's kick-off, where the day
							was used for game and rule analysis, strategic planning, and deliberations of how we would be dividing up our members 
							to complete certain tasks such as designing a chassis, climber, intake, and grabbing mechanism. 
							As of today, we have entered the fabrication and prototyping phase of all the components. Aside from that, we have built 
							a finished drive train as well as completed some aspects of the field.Our business team has also been hard at work 
							contacting sponsors daily, scheduling meetings, as well as prepping for a post Build Season event(details will be provided later)! 
							This week, Dominick, Emilie, and Cruz met with Kurt Madden, Chief Technology Officer of Fresno Unified, and had the 
							amazing opportunity to speak with him about the FIRST program and the impact and opportunities it provides to students. 
							On Friday, Emilie and Garrett went out to speak with Aquasports in hopes of re-establishing our sponsorship with them 
							to which they were successful! Once again, thank you for all your support and if there are any questions or concerns 
							feel free to contact the team.
							Provided below are several photos taken by our students to highlight the week. As always, stay tuned for next week!</p>

							<h2>Week Two</h2>
							<p>As the second week of Build Season comes to a close, Mindcraft has continued to make strides in building a highly competitive robot 
							for this years competition: FIRST Power Up. As always, all the hard work our students put in would not be possible without the help of 
							our amazing and valued sponsors. We would like to give a special shout out to YWD Industrial for meeting with Andrew E., Dominick, and 
							Dylan to continue their lasting relationship with the team. With their help, our team can continue to showcase the impact of STEM 
							education on students, as well as the Central Valley. We would also like to give a special shout out to Aquasports for renewing their 
							sponsorship with the team as well! Our sub teams have been hard at work this week too! All teams working on mechanisms for the robot have 
							started prototyping, as well as entering the iteration phase of the design process. The business team has continued contacting sponsors, as 
							well as holding their weekly meetings with Mrs. Walton and Mrs. Laval in order to execute all behind the scenes actions.
							As last week, I would like to end off this week's recap with some of highlights! 
							</p>

							<h2>Week Three</h2>
							<p>As week three of Build Season closes, Mindcraft has moved past prototyping their mechanisms for our robot, and have moved on to fabricating 
							our components. We would like to give a special shout-out to all parents who provided meals this week! As always, the students and mentors are 
							extremely grateful for your gratitude, and all ate well. Without the help of our amazing parents, surviving the long days here at the Mindcraft lab 
							would be a lot harder.Mariah Walton, Mendy Alkotob, along with our Business subgroup decided to surprise the team with a project they took off with 
							at the beginning of Build Season; a Build Season shirt! This year's Build Season shirt was designed by our very own Christina Gomez. Congratulations
							on the winning design! 
							As per usual, I would like to end off this week's recap with some highlights!
